## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 0.4.x to 0.5.x

**Database Changes**:

```javascript
// New team-related fields added to User model
{
  teams: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Team' }],
  notificationSettings: {
    email: { type: Boolean, default: true },
    push: { type: Boolean, default: true },
    // ... other settings
  }
}

// New Task model enhancements
{
  team: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Team' },
  isTeamTask: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  completedBy: [{
    user: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
    completedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
  }],
  // ... other enhancements
}
```

**API Changes**:

```javascript
// New endpoints added
POST /teams                    // Create team
GET /teams                     // Get user's teams
POST /teams/:id/invite         // Invite user to team
PUT /teams/invitations/:id/respond // Respond to invitation

// Enhanced endpoints
GET /tasks/assigned            // Now supports team filtering
PUT /tasks/:id/complete        // Now tracks who completed the task
```

**Frontend Changes**:

```dart
// New dependencies added to pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_heatmap_calendar: ^1.0.5
  home_widget: ^0.7.0+1
  flutter_background_service: ^5.1.0
  flutter_secure_storage: ^9.2.4

// API base URL configuration updated
const String apiBaseUrl = kIsWeb
    ? 'https://your-backend-url.com'
    : (kReleaseMode 
        ? 'https://your-backend-url.com'
        : 'http://10.0.2.2:10000');
```

## Known Issues

### Version 0.5.1

- **Web Platform**: localStorage used instead of secure storage (limitation of web platform)
- **iOS Notifications**: Require additional setup in Xcode for production builds
- **Widget Updates**: May take up to 1 minute to reflect changes on home screen
- **Background Sync**: Limited to 10-second intervals to balance performance and battery

### Workarounds

- **Web Security**: Consider implementing httpOnly cookies for production web deployments
- **iOS Setup**: Follow Firebase documentation for iOS notification setup
- **Widget Performance**: Widget updates are throttled to prevent excessive battery drain
- **Sync Frequency**: Polling interval can be configured in TimerService

## Deprecation Notices

### Version 0.6.0 (Planned)

- **Legacy API Endpoints**: `/tasks/user` will be deprecated in favor of `/tasks/assigned`
- **Old Widget Format**: Current widget data format will be replaced with more efficient structure
- **Deprecated Fields**: `tasksAssigned` array in User model (replaced by relationship queries)

### Migration Timeline

- **0.6.0**: Deprecation warnings added
